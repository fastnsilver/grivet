[introduction]
= Introduction

Provides end-points for type definition and verification.
In addition provides end-points for linking and unlinking JSON Schema to pre-defined types.

[[overview]]
= Overview

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs
This service tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP verbs.
|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PATCH`
| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource, full updates only

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes
This service tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| Standard response for successful HTTP requests.
The actual response will depend on the request method used.
In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource.
In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.

| `201 Created`
| The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.

| `204 No Content`
| The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.

| `400 Bad Request`
| The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.

[[resources-type-definition]]
== Type definition
A type definition is a specification that includes a `name`, `description`, and `attributes`. Attributes are supplied in a map where each key is a name and each value is one of a number of supported attribute types.


[[resource-define-type]]
=== Define a type

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/define-type/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Example response

include::{snippets}/define-type/http-response.adoc[]


[[resource-define-types]]
=== Define n types

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/define-types/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Example response

include::{snippets}/define-types/http-response.adoc[]


[[resource-undefine-type]]
=== Undefine a type

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/undefine-type/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Example response

include::{snippets}/undefine-type/http-response.adoc[]


[[resource-get-type-definition]]
=== Fetch a type definition

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/get-type-definition/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Example response

include::{snippets}/get-type-definition/http-response.adoc[]


[[resource-get-all-type-definitions]]
=== Fetch all type definitions

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/get-all-type-definitions/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Example response

include::{snippets}/get-all-type-definitions/http-response.adoc[]


[[resources-schema]]
== Schema
JSON Schema (see http://json-schema.org/) may be linked and unlinked to pre-defined types. When a schema is linked to a pre-defined type, all requests to store that type will first be validated against the schema, with schema violations being reported in the response of a failed attempt to store that type.

[[resource-link-schema]]
=== Link schema

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/link-schema/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Example response

include::{snippets}/link-schema/http-response.adoc[]


[[resource-unlink-schema]]
=== Unlink schema

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/unlink-schema/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Example response

include::{snippets}/unlink-schema/http-response.adoc[]
