[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes
This service tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `202 Accepted`
| The request has been accepted and may result in a resource being created, updated or deleted depending on the op code.

| `400 Bad Request`
| The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).
